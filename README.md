# IFIC SmartLearn – React Demo (Vite + Tailwind)

A minimal, beautiful 7-screen demo you saw in chat – built with React (no backend).

## ✨ Screens
Welcome → Login → Dashboard → Courses → Course Details → Certificate → Admin

## 🛠️ Setup
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# open the printed URL (e.g. http://localhost:5173)
```

## 🧱 Stack
- React 18 + Vite
- Tailwind CSS 3 (utility classes already included)

## 🧩 Notes
- All data is mocked in-memory.
- To wire your Spring Boot API later, replace the mocked parts with `fetch/axios` calls.
